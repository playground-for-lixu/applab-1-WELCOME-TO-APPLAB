# About Me
Hello! My name is Christian and I live in Shanghai, China. I spend time exploring the intersections of management, creativity, art and technology. I have a lot of ideas and I make a lot of stuff: messaging apps, cryptocurrency hardware, virtual reality games and educational content. I teach students at NYU Shanghai with the goal of helping them understand the intersection of ideas and realities.

I'm a founding member of NYU Shanghai, China's first Sino-American university. I was on the ground floor putting in the plumbing, and was initially responsible for planning and operations to establish the school in Shanghai. Currently I'm teaching and researching full time, while continuing to build interesting products and art in my spare time.

My diverse skill set lends itself well to small, nimble teams. I pride myself on my ability to take risks to create new things. I work efficiently, play multiple roles and speak many languages (programming, business, Chinese). I know enough about most things to sound like an expert on technology, project management, software engineering, digital prototyping, corporate and venture finance, capital markets, macroeconomics and the Chinese innovation ecosystem.

# The Benefits and Costs of My Digital Life
In the first class, I mentioned that applications of the Internet improve lives and makes the world a better place, but we must work to improve the positive and mitigate or remove the negative impacts of a digital life.

* Give 3 specific examples of a positive change you’ve *personally* experienced as a result of an application of the Internet, be sure to specifically name the application (e.g., email, instant messaging, social media, etc…)
* Give 3 specific examples of a negative impact you’ve *personally* experienced as a result of an application of the Internet. For each example, indicate how you could mitigate the impact (make it less severe, or nonexistent).
